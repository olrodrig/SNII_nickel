# Nickel-56 masses of normal Type II supernovae

Light curves of Type II supernovae (SNe II) are characterized by a phase called radioactive tail. In this phase, the energy sources are the gamma-rays and positrons produced by the radioactive decay of the unstable cobalt isotope Co-56 (daughter of the unstable nickel isotope Ni-56) into the stable iron isotope Fe-56. The luminosity during the radioactive tail is, therefore, a good estimate of the Ni-56 mass ejected in the explosion.

In Rodríguez et al. (2020, submitted to MNRAS) I developed a routine to estimate Ni-56 masses of normal SNe II, called **SNII_nickel**. The routine computes luminosities using the photometry in one optical band (VrRiI) along with the bolometric correction (BC) technique. This routine also detects and corrects for gamma-ray leakage from the ejecta assuming the analytical deposition function of [Jeffery (1999)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999astro.ph..7015J/abstract).
